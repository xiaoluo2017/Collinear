# Pattern-Recognition
A program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points. Given a set of n distinct points in the plane, find every (maximal) line segment that connects a subset of 4 or more of the points.

## Usage
* Open the FastCollinearPoints.java with a text editor.
* Set parameters INPUT_PATH
* Run the program
```java
$ java FastCollinearPoints input400.txt
```

## Demo
We test the program by several sample input files in the following format: An integer n, followed by n pairs of integers (x, y), each between 0 and 32,767. Below are two examples for input200.txt and input400.txt:<br>
